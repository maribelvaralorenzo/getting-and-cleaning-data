# getting-and-cleaning-data

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analys.R, does the following:

1.- Download data.zip if it does not exist. 
2.- Load train and test datasets. Load features. 
3.- Concatenate data tables
4.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6.- merge columns to get the data "data"
7.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
8.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
